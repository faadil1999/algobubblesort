# algobubblesort
bubble sort in C++
This algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent element is compared and the elements
are swapped if they are not in order.
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of O(n^2) where n is the number of items.
